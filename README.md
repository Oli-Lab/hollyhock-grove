# Hollyhock Grove

Grove is a catch-all add-on for various native Usine Hollyhock modules

The idea is actually to have a central location of code and builds, not
only of my own modules but also of anyone in the community who would like
to have some modules hosted here.

In my opinion this would improve the longevity of the user contributions,
as code and (worse for users!) builds disappear over time.

The Grove will also be available directly as an add-on within Usine.
