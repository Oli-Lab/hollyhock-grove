# Hollyhock Grove

Grove is a catch-all add-on for various native Usine Hollyhock modules

The idea is actually to have a central location of code and builds. This can be
difficult to achieve, so git seems like a good option. The advantage here is that
progress never needs to wait on a single person.

The Grove will also be available directly as an add-on within Usine. 

It's off to a great start already, with contributions by 23fx23 and oli_lab.

TODO:

- Native ports of all the midi-on-my-mind scripts
- Tool to automate builds and organize add-on releases
- 'Blank Slate' project files for both Visual Studio and Xcode
	(ideally with a generator tool)
